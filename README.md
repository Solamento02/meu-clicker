# My clicker app
It's just like a cookie clicker, but has dark mode and light mode cuz I was trying to understand how it works. </br>
If you want mess up with the code, when you extract the zip use this command on the folder to get the dependencies:
````
npm install
````
Since I used expo you run the command
```
npx expo start
```
Have fun!ðŸ˜‰
